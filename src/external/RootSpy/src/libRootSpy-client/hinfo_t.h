/// Due to the asynchronous nature of this program, it is difficult to
/// use pointers to keep track of objects in the traditional C++ way.
/// Most information is kept in containers and those may be modified
/// at any time causing all of their elements to be relocated in memory
/// making it dangerous to keep pointers to individual elements outside
/// of mutex locks.
///
/// The solution here is to use the minimal amount of info to uniquely
/// identify a histogram+server bundled into an object that can be passed
/// around in place of a pointer. Unfortunately, one will still need to
/// lock a mutex, find a pointer to the hinfo_t object using the hinfoid_t
/// and then release the mutex after they are done with the hinfo_t pointer.
///
/// To accomodate simpler code for finding the right hinfo_t structure,
/// the hinfo_t class is made to derive from hinfoid_t.



/// in hinfo_t, the information for each of the hists is stored,
/// ie: name, path, type, bin limit, and some flags;
