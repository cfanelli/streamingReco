This directory contains source for a simple
program that can be used to generate histograms
that the RootSpy client can spy on as they are
being filled. It is meant primarily as an easy
way to test an installation of RootSPY is 
working, but also serves as a simple example
of how to make a producer program. (The 
RootSpy part is really just 2 lines in the
source plus what's needed in the Makefile).
