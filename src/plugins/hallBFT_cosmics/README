#This plugin is supposed to create ALL the factories for hallB tests with FT triggers
#The idea behind using a plugin is the following:
## The main reconstruction code can stay inside the reconstruction framework, in the "FT" folder. Eventually, it won't get called
## Here we place only the TriggerDecision factories
