		 Ideally, one would recognize the hit type from the hit itself, and have one JANA2 factory per hit - hits may be later processed differently.
		 One can judge this from the crate/slot/channel combination, but this is setup-dependent.
		 For the moment, this is not supported. Hence, for the moment I differentiate between waveboard and fa250 by considering that the fa250 has no samples, only time and charge.
